# Finite-Element-Method-Implementation-using-PyGMSH-meshing-in-Python-
Starting from the weak form solution, the mesh of the given domain is generated to using PyGMSH, and then solved using the Finite Element Method, all in Python. The results vary the refinement of the mesh and provide a comparison to the analytical results. 

# Project Structure
- `src/` – Core Python Script including the PyGMSH meshing and FEA solution 
- `data/` – Plots for mesh, analytical solution, and FEA solution with varying mesh sizes. 
- `docs/` – Detailed project report
